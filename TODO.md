## ðŸš€ Immediate Issues Fixed âœ…

### ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced Export Features (COMPLETED)

- [x] **Added copy-only button** - New clipboard button that copies PNG without downloading
- [x] **Added table support** - Tables now render properly with theme-aware styling
- [x] **Fixed code block spacing** - Reduced excessive margins between code blocks
- [x] **Updated example content** - Default markdown now includes the table example you requested:
- [x] **Fixed bullet points** - Added proper list-style-type and list-style-position to display bullet points correctly
- [x] **Fixed code block margins** - Reduced outer margins from 1rem to 0.75rem for tighter spacing with surrounding content
- [x] **Fixed table row styling** - Replaced generic currentColor with theme-specific colors for better alternating rows and hover effects
- [ ] Export image wrong: the image that export or copied differ from the previewed in website. Mainly in the horizontal when faced with the code block or inline code block or the Horizontal Rules.
